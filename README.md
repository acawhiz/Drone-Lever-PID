# Drone Lever PID

üöÄ A hybrid PID-controlled lever system using DE10-Nano FPGA, BDCM, and real-time C# visualization.

This project controls a physical **lever** that is lifted by a **brushless DC motor (BDCM)** and **propeller**, with closed-loop feedback using a **PID controller**. The project is implemented on an **Intel DE10-Nano FPGA board**, and includes a C# interface for real-time PID parameter display and tuning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- üß† **PID Control**  
  - Switchable between **FPGA-implemented PID** and **C#-based PID**
  - Tunable parameters: P, I, D gains, update rate, output limits

- üõ∞ **Sensor Integration**  
  - Uses the **ADXL345** accelerometer to detect lever angle/tilt
  - Samples vibration/noise data for filtering and control

- üåÄ **Filtering**  
  - Implements an **exponential moving average filter** to reduce motor vibration impact on sensor readings

- üíª **C# Interface**  
  - Live plotting and parameter updates
  - Option to simulate PID in software or defer control to the FPGA
